# TCP Service Exercise

In this page you can find more information about the TCP Service exercise.

## Solutions

In the following pages you can find more about the solution, next steps and recommendations/discussions about the architecture.

- [Initial solution](initial_solution.md)
- [Recommendations](recommendations.md)

## Software Development

You are tasked with starting a new project. You have received the following list of requirements from our product team.

We require a non-critical API service (~90% SLO) for some already-existing internal services to use. The service should
accept commands on a TCP port composed of ASCII strings. The server outputs an ASCII string as response.

The following commands are accepted:

- `WHO`: outputs the total number of clients connected;
- `WHERE`: outputs the id of the server (a unique identifier);
- `WHY`: output the string `42`.

Please leave enough time to provide a list of items that would need to be added to the project before it would be
considered production-ready. (Add this in a README.md next to the source code.)

Consider:

- Maintainability (code hygiene, code robustness, documentation)
- Deployability
- Observability

In this part we are interested in:

1. code correctness;
1. how you structure a coding project;
1. tooling you add to achieve the above goals;
1. how straightforward it would be for someone else to continue development where you leave off;
1. any decisions youâ€™ve had to make along the way (please include these in the README.md).

In this part, we are not interested in:

1. how it fits into the larger ecosystem;
1. an exhaustive implementation of all the tooling.

## System Design

The server you have written in part 1 has now been used in production as part of our non-customer facing micro service
architecture for a few months. The engineering team would now like to leverage it as part of our customer-facing
infrastructure and as such the target SLO is now 99.95%.

Design a distributed system composed of at least 3 servers. Clients can connect to any server available.

Server response will change to reflect the distributed architecture:

- `WHO`: the outputs should show the total number of clients connected to all available servers;
- `WHERE`: the id of the server needs to be a globally unique identifier.

Describe the distributed architecture, in particular how you would achieve state replication and fault tolerance.

You should justify your ideas in light of the CAP theorem - do you need more information from the engineering /
product teams?

> Note: code is not required. Design the architecture, describe the architecture, use pseudo code if necessary.

## Points for discussion afterwards

- What considerations would you have if the SLO were 99.9999%?
- What changes would you encourage the product team to make in their requirements?
- How does this service fit into a larger microservice ecosystem? What tooling will it require to make it useful?
